* Shadow-reagent
A minimal setup for running reagent apps using shadow-cljs.

Setup adapted from [[https://www.manueluberti.eu/programming/2018/11/14/deps-shadow-cljs/][this post.]]

** Cider setup
If it can't be used inside Emacs it's totally useless.

1. Run =npx shadow-cljs watch frontend= in terminal
2. Run cider-connect-cljs =C-c M-C)= in Emacs.
3. Open index.html in browser.
   
OR

1. Run cider-jack-in-cljs =C-c M-J=.
2. Select =shadow= as the repl type.
3. Select =:app= as the build.

** compile and distribute
- compile - =npx shadow-cljs compile frontend=
- distribute - =npx shadow-cljs release frontend=
